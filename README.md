# Wikipedia Search
## via Wikipedia's API

This project was to create a simplified search using Wikipedia's API. The interface was designed to emulate a typical search engine, with search results appearing in the same page.

-Users are provided a simple interface to enter their search terms and receive results.

-All results include a description of each returned result.

-All search results are linked directly to an actual Wikipedia entry.

-All results are filtered by most relevant to least relevant to the search terms entered.

-Users are also offered a "Random Search" button on the interface to produce a random search entry.

-All searches, results and descriptions are responsive to various devices and screen sizes.
